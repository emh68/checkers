## Overview
This project is a Checkers game implemented in Java with a clear separation between game logic and user interface. It focuses on building a rule-driven application that correctly manages game state, turn order, captures, and win conditions.

## Description
The software includes a complete checkers engine that runs as a console-based MVP and a JavaFX graphical interface built on the same core logic. The game supports forced captures, multi-jump sequences, king promotion, turn enforcement, and automatic win detection when a player has no remaining pieces or legal moves.

The purpose of this project was to strengthen my understanding of Java through object-oriented design, clear class responsibilities, and state management. I also wanted experience integrating a JavaFX graphical user interface.
